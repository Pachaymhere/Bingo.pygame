## Overview

This project is a simple implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game using the Pygame library in Python. Though the game is Tic-Tac-Toe, I named this game as Bingo as we are happy if we win. It provides a graphical interface for two players to take turns and play the game.

## Features

- Two-player turn-based gameplay.
- Visual indication of the winner or a draw.
- Restart the game with the press of a button.

## Prerequisites

Before running the game, ensure you have Python and Pygame installed on your system.

```bash
pip install pygame
```

## How to Run

Execute the following command in the terminal:

```bash
python main.py
```

## Controls

- **Left Click**: Place a mark on the grid.
- **Spacebar**: Restart the game.

## Code Structure

- **main.py**: Entry point for the game.
- **my_game.py**: Main game logic and Pygame setup.
- **test_case.py**: Unit tests for the game logic.

## How to Play

1. Players take turns clicking on the grid to place their marks (X or O).
2. The game ends when a player wins or the board is full (a draw).
3. Press the **Spacebar** to restart the game after it has ended.
